                            the Arduino IDE. The Artemis Nano is a development board created by Sparkfun Electronics to
                            use in small-scale projects. In ECE 4160, Artemis is programmed using Python and the Arduino
                            IDE. The lab involves installing the Arduino software and learning how to set up and use the
                            Artemis board by running a handful of example programs on it.</p>

                        <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                        <b>Installations.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which involved installing the
                            Arduino IDE onto the computer being used for the lab. When you go to the Downloads page on
                            the Arduino website, there are several versions of the software available for different
                            operating systems. I used macOS with an Intel processor, so that is the version that I
                            installed.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Downloads.jpeg" alt="Downloads" style="width:912px;height:400px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <b>The Setup.</b>
                        <p>Once the software was downloaded, it was time to set everything up according to the
                            instructions referenced under “Resources” in the Introduction. First, I connected the
                            Artemis board to my computer using a USB-C. Next, I opened the IDE and installed the
                            SparkFun Apollo3 package. This package contains source files, libraries, and other tools
                            that would allow me to use the Arduino software with Artemis. Once that was done, I could
                            select the Artemis Nano board from the newly available board options.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Selected.jpeg" alt="Selected" style="width:850px;height:400px;">
                        <b>Examples.</b>
                        <p>Now that everything was set up, it was time to gain familiarity with the Artemis board by
                            testing out a few example programs available on the IDE as well as some Artemis-specific
                            examples from the SparkFun package. The examples that were used for this lab were “Blink it
                            Up” from the IDE and “Example2_Serial”, “Example4-analogRead”, and
                            “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” from the package. For all the examples, I had to first manually
                            select the board, then press the “Verify” and “Upload” buttons on the top left corner of the
                            pop-up window.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Choose.png" alt="Choose" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <p>In the “Blink it Up” example, one of the LEDs on the board would blink every second. In the
                            code there is a loop, so the blinking doesn’t stop unless we stop the program. Below is an
                            image of the loop as well as a video of the blinking light.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Exampleone.png" alt="Exampleone" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <!--<video src="assets/img/Exvidone.png" alt="Exvidone" style="width:615px;height:400px;">-->
                        <p>In the “Example2_Serial” example, I was able to “talk” to the board by typing in messages in
                            the serial monitor and the Artemis would “answer” me by repeating what I wrote back to me.
                            Our “conversation” is shown below.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Exampletwo.png" alt="Exampletwo" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <p>In the “Example4-analogRead” example, the serial monitor continuously outputs the temperature
                            read (raw ADC) from the sensor. I could change the temperature by first rubbing (warming)
                            the board and then blowing (cooling) it. The temperature reads from these two actions are
                            shown below in the same order.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Examplethreeone.png" alt="Examplethreeone"

                        <p>In the “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” the serial monitor continuously outputs the frequency
                            detected by the microphone. Below is a video showing how the frequency read changes as I hum
                            with various pitches.</p>

                        <p>The importance of Lab 1 was to allow students to gain some basic knowledge and skills for the
                            Artemis Nano board and the Arduino IDE. This experience provides a smooth transition into
                            more complex projects because it ensures that the board works properly for simple tasks.
                            Moreover, it demonstrated some capabilities of the Artemis board that could be applied to
                            future Labs in ECE 4160.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of Lab 2 is to enable communication between the Artemis board and the computer
                            using Bluetooth, which was done so that in future labs Bluetooth can be used to send data.
                            The lab involved establishing the connection and then testing it by trying out several
                            different processing commands on the Artemis board.</p>

                        <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                        <b>The Setup.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which consisted of several parts.
                            The first part involved installing Python 3, a virtual environment, and several python
                            packages. Next I downloaded the codebase, set it up, and organized the directory. After
                            this, I started the Jupyter server. Lastly, I installed ArduinoBLE using the library manager
                            in the Arduino IDE.</p>
                        <p>Before moving forward, it’s important to understand what Bluetooth is, what’s included in the
                            provided codebase, and how both of them work.</p>
                        <b>Bluetooth.</b>
                        <p>Bluetooth is a method of wireless communication where any device can obtain information from
                            available data. As described in the ArtemisBLE reference in the Introduction, there’s a
                            peripheral device that behaves similarly to a bulletin board: it contains all the data and
                            any device in the system can read it.</p>
                        <b>Codebase.</b>
                        <p>The codebase splits the lab into two main parts. First, we have the code in the Arduino IDE
                            (located in the ble_arduino folder), which is what gets run on the Artemis board. Second, we
                            have the Python code in the Jupyter Notebook (located in the ble_python folder). This is
                            where we run our commands including establishing the Bluetooth connection and running
                            example commands. Both folders have files that allow the two parts to work together. It’s
                            very important that both halves of the codebase are consistent with each other, otherwise
                            communication will fail.</p>
                        <p>At this point we could determine our board’s MAC address by running the ble_arduino.ino
                            sketch located in the ble_arduino folder in our codebase. The output of the program with the
                            board’s MAC address is shown here:</p>

                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <b>Configurations.</b>
                        <p>The first task was to change some configurations in the codebase. First, I copied the MAC
                            address obtained in the prelab and pasted it in the connection.yaml file in Jupyter. Next, I
                            changed out BLEService UUID so that my computer connected to the correct Artemis board. I
                            put this new UUID address in the connection.yaml file and the ble_arduino.ino sketch.</p>
                        <p>I obtained the new UUID by creating a new cell in my Jupyter notebook and running the
                            commands as illustrated below:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/generating_uuid.png" alt="generating_uuid"
                            style="width:640px;height:400px;">
                        <p>Next, I ensured that the addresses and the command types agree between conneciton.yaml and
                            ble_arduino. Below are images of the updated connection.yaml and ble_arduino.ino files, in
                            that order:</p>

                        <p>After changing the configurations, I ensured that the Bluetooth connection works properly by
                            running the demo.ipynb file in Jupyter. The two screenshots below demonstrate that I was
                            able to connect the two devices:</p>

                        <p>Below are two more images that prove that the demo.ipynb file ran successfully. First, we get
                            a screenshot of the "PING" and "SET_TWO_INTS" commands on Jupyter. Second, we have the
                            output of these commands in the arduino software. Both commands were executed successfully.

                        <b>Task 1.</b>
                        <p>The “Send Echo Command” takes as an input some message from the user and then prints it back
                            out, just like a real echo! To implement it in the ble_arduino.ino sketch, I copied and
                            pasted the code from the “Ping” command and changed two lines. Then, I wrote two commands in
                            the Jupyter file using the “Ping” command as an example:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_1.png" alt="task_1" style="width:869px;height:400px;">
                        <p>The next three commands are new, so for all of them I first had to add the name of each
                            command to CommandTypes in the ble_arduino.ino sketch and to the CMD class in cmd_types.py,
                            as shown:

                        <p>The “Get Time Command” outputs the long “currentMillis” in the following format:
                            “T:(currentMillis)”. To implement it in the ble_arduino.ino sketch, I modified the code from
                            the “Ping'' command. Next, I wrote the new command in Jupyter:</p>

                        <b>Task 3.</b>
                        <p>The “Notification Handler” allows updated data from the Artemis board to be continuously
                            printed out, which is very useful for the next two commands. To write the code, I took
                            inspiration from my classmates:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_3.png" alt="task_3" style="width:876px;height:300px;">

                        <b>Task 4.</b>
                        <p>The “GET_TEMP_5s” sends the internal die temperature readings for different time stamps in
                            the following format “T:(time)|C:(temperature)|...”. Measurements are taken once per second
                            for five seconds. To implement this, I created a loop that repeats 5 times and has a delay
                            of 1 second after every round to ensure that measurements are taken once per second:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_4.png" alt="task_4" style="width:615px;height:400px;">

                        <p>The “GET_TEMP_5s_RAPID” is almost like “GET_TEMP_5s”, except in this case we take as many
                            samples as possible over 5 seconds. Thus, to implement this I had to modify the
                            “GET_TEMP_5s” code to have a while loop that repeats until the current time is 5 seconds and
                            that doesn’t have a delay:</p>

                        <p>It’s important to note that there is a limitation when it comes to Bluetooth communication.
                            Let’s take 5 seconds of 16-bit values taken at 150 Hz as an example. In total, we would
                            have:
                        </p>
                        <p>(5 seconds)*(150 times/second)*(16 bits)*(1 byte/8 bits) = 1500 bytes of data every 5
                            seconds.</p>
                        <p>We’re given that the Artemis board has 384000 bytes of RAM. This means that the maximum
                            number of 5-second cycles that we can have is the following:</p>
                        <p>(384000 bytes)/(1500 bytes) = 256</p>
                        <p>So the Artemis board can’t handle more than 256 rounds of such 5-second cycles.</p>

                        <p>The importance of Lab 2 was to enable a wireless method of communication between the computer
                            and the Artemis board. To do this, we used Bluetooth BLE, a wireless communication system
                            that allows data transfer between two devices. As a result, we now have a convenient way to
                            exchange information between robots to use in future labs.

                            was done by attaching a varied (first one, then two) number of sensors to the Artemis board
                            and then testing them by obtaining data. Specifically, we attached Time-of-Flight (ToF) so
                            that our robot could detect how far it is from surrounding objects.</p>

                        <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                        <b>I2C Address.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which involved reading through the
                            VL53L1X API user manual and data sheet while looking out for the I2C sensor address.</p>
                        <p>According to the datasheet, the I2C address is 0x52:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/i2c_address.png" alt="i2c_address" style="width:885px;height:380px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>Using Two Sensors.</b>
                        <p>In this lab, we eventually would use 2 ToF sensors in parallel. The advantage of using two
                            sensors rather than one is that with two sensors our robot would be able to obtain more
                            information and detect more obstacles than it would with just one sensor. For example, I
                            currently plan to put the sensors on the front left and the front right sides of the robot
                            so it could detect obstacles that are either in front, to the left, or to the right. That
                            way, it can react appropriately by either backing off or changing its trajectory.</p>
                        <b>Wiring Diagram.</b>
                        <p>Another task in the prelab was to plan out the wiring for some components in the lab. Below
                            is the wiring diagram, which includes the Artemis board, the Qwiic breakout board, and the
                            two ToF sensors:</p>

                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <b>Installations.</b>
                        <p>First, I installed the parkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library using the Arduino IDE
                            library manager:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/distance_sensor_lib.png" alt="distance_sensor_lib"
                            style="width:270px;height:515px;">
                        <p>This would allow me to test the ToF sensors using an example from this library later in the
                            lab.</p>
                        <b>Soldering.</b>
                        <p>Next, I soldered two ToF sensors to Qwiic connectors so that I could attach them to the
                            Artemis board via the Qwiic MultiPort breakout board. The Qwiic connectors each had four
                            wires: red, black, blue, and yellow. According to convention, I first soldered the red wire
                            to the voltage source and the black wire to the ground port. Next, I referred to the
                            schematic on the SparkFun Qwiic MultiPort web page to figure out how to solder the remaining
                            two wires. The order of the wires on the connectors gave away which port each one should be
                            connected to:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/wire_colors.png" alt="wire_colors" style="width:461px;height:307px;">
                        <p>And so I soldered the blue wire to SDA and the yellow wire to SCL. I ended up with two
                            sensors that looked like this:</p>

                        <b>One Sensor.</b>
                        <p>The first experiment involved an Artemis board connected to just one sensor. To join them, I
                            attached both the sensor and the board to the Qwiic MultiPort breakout board using Qwiic
                            connectors. The resulting setup is shown below:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/one_sensor.png" alt="one_sensor" style="width:744px;height:520px;">
                        <p>Now that the physical components were ready, it was time to test them.</p>
                        <p>To start, I needed to ensure that we are using the correct I2C address and to familiarize
                            myself with I2C commands. So I connected the Artemis board and sensor setup to my computer
                            and ran the “Example1_wire_I2C” example from the Apollo3 library. As shown below, the
                            address does not match with what I expected; I expected 0x52, but instead got 0x29:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/i2c_ex.png" alt="i2c_ex" style="width:500px;height:360px;">
                        <p></p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/0x29.png" alt="0x29" style="width:804px;height:540px;">
                        <p>To do the experiment, I had to choose one of three modes for the maximum expected range of
                            the robot: short/default (1.3 m), medium (3 m) or long (4 m). The best mode to choose for an
                            experiment depends on how far and freely our robot is expected to move. For example, if we
                            allow our robot to freely roam around in a big room, it’s important to be aware of any
                            objects that are some distance away from the robot to avoid collisions. In this experiment,
                            I only intend to move the board a little bit in the vicinity of my computer. The
                            short/default mode is most appropriate for this case because we only care about objects that
                            are close to us. This is what I ended up going with for this lab:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/short_mode.png" alt="short_mode" style="width:670px;height:57px;">
                        <p>After setting everything up, it was time to test the (short) mode that I chose above using
                            the “Example1_ReadDistance” example from the VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/distance_ex.png" alt="distance_ex" style="width:500px;height:360px;">
                        <p>For this part, I had to first ensure accuracy and repeatability of the sensor over some
                            range. To do that, I designed an experiment where I measured the distance of a large box at
                            various positions (10 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm, 250 mm, and 300 mm) and compared it
                            to the program output.</p>
                        <p>Here’s the measurement:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/measurement.png" alt="measurement" style="width:766px;height:535px;">
                        <p>Here’s the corresponding output:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/corr_out.png" alt="corr_out" style="width:692px;height:720px;">
                        <p>I did three trials of the experiment and plotted them below:</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>As we can see, the measurements are almost exact except for when we approach zero: the output
                            reads zero at around 10mm, before the sensor collides with the object.</p>
                        <p>I also had to find the ranging time with StopRanging, without StopRanging, and with just the
                            reading. To do so, I modified the code to compute the ranging time for those conditions:
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/time_one.png" alt="time_one" style="width:351px;height:232px;">
                        <p>Here is a table with my findings:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/time_table.png" alt="time_table" style="width:773px;height:202px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>Two Sensors.</b>
                        <p>After this, it was time to test two sensors at once. First, I had to first change the address
                            of one of the sensors because by default both have the same one: 0x29. To do this, I
                            connected the XSHUT pin of one sensor to one of the Artemis’s pins (green wire in the wiring
                            diagram), as shown below:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/two_sensors.png" alt="two_sensors" style="width:302px;height:403px;">
                        <p>Thereby, I could turn off that sensor to change the address of the other one. Below is the
                            code for that:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/change_add.png" alt="change_add" style="width:910px;height:562px;">
                        <p>I also had to modify the code so that the output showed readings from both sensors. The
                            output below demosntrates my successful implementation:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/two_sensor_out.png" alt="two_sensor_out"
                            style="width:508px;height:313px;">
                        <p>Next, I had to write a program that would allow me to quickly and continuously print the
                            Artemis clock to the Serial while only printing new ToF sensor data when it’s available. To
                            do this, I replaced the default while loop with two if-statements. That way, we only get a
                            reading for a sensor once it’s available. Here’s the code and its output:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/faster.png" alt="faster" style="width:864px;height:540px;">
                        <p></p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_3/faster_out.png" alt="faster_out" style="width:712px;height:518px;">
                        <p>As we can see from the output, our loop currently executes in 4 or 5 ms when there's no
                            reading and two times longer when there is a reading. The limiting factor is therefore just
                            checking whether there is a reading or not.</p>
                        <p>Last, I had to combine the code from this lab with the code from Lab 2 so that the ToF data
                            got sent over to my computer via Bluetooth. Consequently, the output would give time-stamped
                            distance readings instead of temperature readings. Below is my code:</p>
                          <img src="assets/img/lab_3/get_tof.png" alt="get_tof" style="width:711px;height:558px;">
                        <p>Here is the output of the code:</p>

                        <p>In Lab 3, we used a varied number of sensors to allow our robot to gather information
                            from its surroundings. This is a very important milestone because giving a robot some
                            way to perceive the environment is the first step for it to be able to interact with the
                            outside world. Moreover, this step gives us an opportunity to explore a variety of new
                            and interesting projects moving forward!

                        <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which involved reading through the ICM-20948 data sheet and just in general familiarizing oneself with the breakout board and the lab procedure.</p>

                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <b>Set Up the IMU.</b>
                        <p>To begin, we had to set up the IMU. First, I installed the SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/imu_install.png" alt="imu_install"
                            style="width:280px;height:564px;">
                        <p>Next, I connected the IMU to my Artemis board using the QWIIC connectors like so:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/imu_connections.png" alt="imu_connections"
                            style="width:606px;height:702px;">
                        <p>Then, I ran the Example1_Basics code from that library to make sure that the IMU works:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/imu_ex_code.png" alt="imu_ex_code"
                            style="width:864px;height:540px;">
                        <p>Below is a screenshot of the serial monitor output, which shows data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope among other things. The accelerometer gives us x,y, and z values (mg) and the gyroscope gives us roll, pitch, and yaw (DPS).</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/basics_works.png" alt="basics_works"
                            style="width:864px;height:540px;">
                        <p>I also made a screen recording of the serial plotter, which shows changes in values when the IMU is moved or rotated, which shows that the IMU responds to changes in motion and position.</p>

                        <p>Note that in the code we see that the AD0_VAL definition is 1. This is expected because according to the data sheet this is the default value when the ADR jumper is not closed. If we wanted to change the I2C address, we would solder the ADR jumper, which would mean that the AD0_VAL definition would be 0. Since we are only using one IMU, we don’t need to do that.</p>
                        <p>Also, I slightly modified the code so that there were three LED blinks at the start, as shown in the video below. That way, we know that the code works!</p>

                        <b>Accelerometer.</b>
                        <p>The next step is to test the accelerometer by measuring roll and pitch values for different orientations of the IMU. To do that, I first needed to convert the x, y, and z values into pitch and roll values, which I did by using the code posted on the course website.</p>
                        <p>First, I made measurements when the IMU is flat on the table:</p>

                        <p>Next, I made measurements when the IMU is flipped 90 degrees to the left:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/accel_1.png" alt="accel_1"

                            style="width:531px;height:495px;">
                        <p>Lastly, I made measurements when the IMU is flipped 90 degrees to the right:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/accel_2.png" alt="accel_2"
                            style="width:561px;height:627px;">

                        <p>As we can see above, the values are quite accurate, although there is slight noise. To analyze this noise, I collected some data and plotted it in the time domain and frequency domain as shown below, respectively.</p>

                        <p>As we can see, we don’t have a lot of noise because there is a built-in LPF in this particular model. This means that noise is reduced and we don’t need an additional low-pass filter.</p>
                        <b>Gyroscope.</b>
                        <p>The next phase was to assess the gyroscope by measuring pitch, roll, and yaw values for different orientations of the IMU. To do that, I first needed to compute the pitch, roll, and yaw values, which I did by using the code posted on the course website.</p>
                        <p>First, I made measurements when the IMU is flat on the table:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_0.jpg" alt="gyr_0"
                            style="width:508px;height:500px;">
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_0_out.png" alt="gyr_0_out"
                            style="width:613px;height:493px;">
                        <p>Next, I made measurements when the IMU is flipped 90 degrees to the left:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_1.jpg" alt="gyr_1"
                            style="width:570px;height:598px;">
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_1_out.png" alt="gyr_1_out"
                            style="width:611px;height:493px;">
                        <p>Lastly, I made measurements when the IMU is flipped 90 degrees to the right:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_2.jpg" alt="gyr_2"
                            style="width:550px;height:550px;">
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/gyr_2_out.png" alt="gyr_2_out"
                            style="width:611px;height:492px;">
                        <p>I also took a video recording of the serial plotter, from which we can see that the gyroscope measurements shift as time goes by:</p>

                            </iframe> -->
                        <p>We can also see this in the measurements; for example when the IMU is flat, the pitch measurement is around -17 when it should be close to zero, meaning that the gyroscope isn’t very accurate. Even though we have a built-in LPF, there is still some noise which can be reduced by implementing a complementary filter:</p>

                        <p>After this, I redid the measurements for all three positions:</p>

                        <p>As we can see, our measurements are much better and more accurate.</p>
                        <b>Sample Data.</b>
                        <p>For this section, I first had to figure out how fast I am able to sample new values. To do that, I printed out the time stamps before the data was collected and after the data was collected:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_4/timing.png" alt="timing"
                            style="width:829px;height:518px;">
                        <p>As we can see, it takes about 2-3 milliseconds. Note that this was after I removed all other print statements to speed up the data collection process.</p>
                        <p>Next, I used bluetooth to collect time-stamped IMU data via Bluetooth and save it into an array:</p>
                        <p>Below is my Arduino code, python code, and the output that it generated in Jupyter:</p>

                        <p>Then, I used bluetooth to collect 5s worth of time-stamped IMU data along with ToF data, which I stored in separate arrays. I did this because having the data separated is more convenient for making plots; instead of having to index, I can just refer to whatever I want to plot.</p>

                        <p>In this lab we are given two kinds of batteries. The first one is 3.7V 850mAh, which we use to power motors via the motor driver. The second one is 3.7V 650mAh, which we use to power the Artemis and other digital electronics. To make the 650mAh battery compatible with the Artemis board, I had to solder the cables from the battery to JST connectors as shown below:</p>

                        <p>The last part of the lab was to play with the toy car! First, I attached the 850mAh battery to the toy car and spent a few minutes testing it out on its own, as shown in the video below:</p>
                        <p>(Note: I disassembled my car for Lab 5 before realizing I have to do this, so I sadly don't have footage for this. However, I am quite confident that I can play with toy cars!)</p>
                        <p>Next, I attached the 650mAh battery to the Artemis board, after which I attached the board and the other components to the car. I spent some time movinging the car around like this, as shown in the video below:</p>

                        <p>In Lab 4, we enabled our robot to measure its own orientation in space and motion with respect to the outside world. This was a logical next step from the previous lab, where we allowed our robot to gather information from its surroundings. Having information about its environment in combination with the ability to determine one’s own orientation in its environment is a major milestone for our robot; it gains many new capabilities and gives us a lot more possibilities to explore.

                        <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                        <p>The primary objective of the prelab is to design a way to wire together the different hardware components. The goal is to parallel-couple the inputs and outputs of the motor drivers so that we can maximize power and the speed of our robot. To do this, we had to overview the documentation and datasheet for the dual motor driver. I also referred to Ryan Chan’s website from last year. Here is the wiring diagram that I ended up with:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/wiring_diagram.jpeg" alt="wiring_diagram"
                            style="width:626px;height:694px;">
                        <p>Like Ryan Chan, I used pins 4 and A5 for one motor driver and pins A14 and A15 for the other one because all these pins can generate PWM signals.</p>
                        <p>The Artemis and motor drivers should be powered from different batteries. This is because we want to maximize the amount of power given to the drivers and minimize power supply noise to the Artemis.</p>

                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <b>Oscilloscope Test.</b>
                        <p>First, I used the wiring diagram that I came up with in the prelab to create connections between the Artemis board and the motor drivers, as shown below:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/wiring_pic.jpg" alt="wiring_pic"
                            style="width:605px;height:806px;">
                        <p>The next step was to show that we can regulate the power on the motor driver output. To do that, we had to test our motor drivers using an oscilloscope. First, I had to write a program using analogWrite to generate PWM signals:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/osc_code.png" alt="osc_code"
                            style="width:559px;height:351px;">
                        <p>Then, I connected one of the motor drivers to a power supply and an oscilloscope, as shown below:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/pwr_setup.jpg" alt="pwr_setup"
                            style="width:604px;height:400px;">
                        <p>I set the power supply to be 3.7 V to match the nominal voltage of the battery that we are using for our robot. I tested out both motor drivers by changing the pin numbers in the code above. Here are the results:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/pwr_0.jpg" alt="pwr_0"
                            style="width:794px;height:525px;">

                        <p>As we can see, we have square waves for both motor drivers, both work properly!</p>
                        <b>Assembling the Car!</b>
                        <p>Once we made sure that our motors can generate PWM signals, it was time to make sure that the wheels can spin forward and backwards. To do that, I first wrote code that would enable one set of wheels spin forward and backwards:</p>

                            style="width:445px;height:662px;">
                        <p>Next, I took a video of two wheels spinning in both directions:</p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Once I knew that I could make one pair of wheels spin properly, I tried to do the same for all four wheels. Below are the code that I used and a video of the wheels spinning, respectively.</p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Next, it was time to assemble the car! I inserted all the components, including the Artemis, the ToF sensors, the IMU and the motor drivers into the car, like so:</p>

                        <b>Controlling the Car.</b>
                        <p>The last part of the lab was to test our robot! The first step was to find the lower limit of the PWM duty cycle, or in other words, what’s the smallest signal I can send to my robot and still have the wheels rolling on the ground. I found this value to be about X, which is Y% of the duty cycle. Below is a video of the robot moving with this PWM value:</p>
                        <p>Next, I tested my robot to see if it can travel in a straight line, meaning that the right and left wheels spin at the same rate. I found there to be a slight difference in the wheel speeds: the right wheels turn slightly faster than the left ones, which makes the car move slightly to the left. I corrected this by subtracting X from the right motor. Here is a video of the robot traveling in a straight line after all necessary adjustments:</p>
                        <p> </p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Lastly, I had to demonstrate open-loop, untethered control of my robot. To do this, I first had to program the robot to complete a sequence of tasks. Below is my code, with the comments explaining what I wanted the robot to do in each step:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_5/open_loop.jpg" alt="open_loop"
                            style="width:500px;height:667px;">
                        <p>Below is the video of my robot doing these tasks:</p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>As we can see, the robot’s movements were consistent with the code!</p>

                        <p>In Lab 5, we replaced manual control of the toy car with open loop control by replacing the original board in the toy car with the hardware that we created over the past few labs. This is a major milestone in our robot development journey because it combines everything that we have done in ECE 4160 so far and paves way for new and interesting experiments!

                      <p>The goal of Lab 6 was to gain experience with PID or closed-loop control. The advantage of closed-loop control over open-loop control is that we are giving our robot the ability to respond to certain stimuli instead of allowing it to drive around in a predetermined way. For this lab, we had to choose between two possible tasks, Task A and Task B. Task A focuses on position control and Task B focuses on orientation control. I chose to complete Task A.</p>

                      <b>THE PRELAB.</b>
                      <p>The primary objective of the prelab is to design a way to facilitate debugging. And so to prepare for this lab, I made a  copy of my ECE 4160 folder, created a new virtual environment, and changed the structure of my code. In previous labs, I had most of my code in cases that I would call in Jupyter and to obtain data, it would be sent to my computer in real time. This was not a very good structure for two reasons. First, when the code is in cases, it can’t be interrupted or terminated before it’s complete. Also, sending bluetooth data in real time is time-consuming and inefficient.</p>
                      <p>To solve the problems above, I decided to change the structure of my code such that most of my code was located in the main loop and I had a few short cases. The main loop is where data is collected and saved into an array without sending it to my computer right away. One of the cases converts the data array into a string and sends it via bluetooth. The other cases are mostly there to change values of global variables. This is a better system because if most of the code is in the main loop, we can make interrupts, and sending data over after it’s already been collected is quicker and more efficient.</p>
                      <p>Here is the code that I wrote for the prelab:</p>
